It wants to be a public good at a protocol level, not a company. Solving for the problem of it being a company however, Elon is the singular solution I trust. I trust his mission to extend the light of consciousness. / Twitter\"</h3><p>In principle, I don't believe anyone should own or run Twitter. It wants to be a public good at a protocol level, not a company. Solving for the problem of it being a company however, Elon is the singular solution I trust. I trust his mission to extend the light of consciousness.</p><p><strong>Q: Uh, if “no one should own or run Twitter,” why did Dorsey advocate selling it to Musk… I’m confused?</strong></p><p>A: To get it out of the hands of Wall Street investors, and turn it into a “public good at a protocol level, not a company.” Dorsey and Musk believe it can do more good for humanity if it’s an open technology than if it’s a company owned by any one person or by Wall Street investors trying to maximize profits for shareholders.</p><p><strong>Q: What do you mean, a “public good at a protocol level?” What even is that?</strong></p><p>A: The foundation of the Internet is built on protocols that we mostly take for granted now. TCP/IP and HTTPS enable the web. Modern e-mail is built on top of SMTP and IMAP protocols. Usenet newsgroups are built on top of NNTP. Dorsey envisions a foundational “Twitter” protocol that anyone can implement and run. This would need to become a formal Internet standard, which requires going through the <a href=\"https://www.ietf.org\">Internet Engineering Task Force</a>’s “Request for Comment” (RFC) process. This can take a long time. This is what Bluesky has been working on starting to map out.</p><p><strong>Q: But the </strong><a href=\"https://blueskyweb.xyz\"><strong>Bluesky website</strong></a><strong> says its Beta is “launching soon.” Doesn’t that mean it’s close to ready?</strong></p><p>A: It means they’re ready for you to start experimenting with some ideas. It doesn’t mean it’s close to being a “product” or “useful,” or some sort of viable competitor with any other product or service. And as of yet it’s difficult to know exactly what a service might look like. Eventually, it might form the basis for a new implementation of Twitter that would replace the current product, and it could be open for others to interoperate with — if they can build a functional and useful protocol, which may take years.</p><p><strong>Q: This all sounds crazy. Doesn’t Musk want to make money by owning Twitter?</strong></p><p>A: The goals are more ideological in nature. Musk and his backers believe that the global geopolitical arena was being warped by too much “woke” ideology and censorship, and wanted to fix that by first restoring voices that had previously been silenced —and then implementing technical and algorithmic solutions that allow each user to get the experience they want. They think this can “solve” the problems that people cite about social media content. Making money, they figure, will come from the secondary effects of enabling “free speech” and the possibility of building other services like payments and replacing government on top of such an app. Plus the company’s social graph data is a goldmine for other businesses that may wish to benefit from detailed knowledge of the makeup of society.</p><p><strong>Q: Uh, isn’t it naive to think that there’s a technical solution to harmful content? Isn’t that likely to lead to more radicalization and cultish behavior?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, it’s completely naive and they are being willfully ignorant of the harmful side effects of content. It is a kind of tech fundamentalist solutionism that posits that for any difficult problem, there must be a technical solution. Many sociologists and cultural scholars would argue differently.</p><p><strong>Q: What does Dorsey mean, “I trust [Musk’s] mission to extend the light of consciousness?”</strong></p><p>A: This is a reference to “longtermism,” the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/05/opinion/the-case-for-longtermism.html\">heavily marketed</a> philosophy being promoted by Musk and his friend William MacAskill that asserts the only thing that matters is humanity’s future in space, and that the only goal of the living is to maximize the number of future humans alive, as well as the number of artificial intelligence instances that could possibly exist in the future. This mandate is most often used to brush aside calls for improving conditions and alleviating suffering among the living here on Earth now. Because, the theory goes, giving a poor person a blanket isn’t likely to be as useful for the future of humanity as building a rocket to Mars. Longtermism is heavily influenced by “<a href=\"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/oa-mono/10.4324/9780429426773/russian-nationalism-marlene-laruelle\">Russian Cosmism</a>” and is also directly adjacent to “Effective Altruism.” Musk’s stated mission, which he intends to fulfill in his lifetime, is to “make humanity a multiplanetary species.” The anti-democratic urge in longtermism is rooted in the belief that “mob rule” will lead to nuclear annihilation; we should, Musk thinks, be guided by “wiser” minds — like his and Putin’s apparently.</p><p><strong>Q: Okay, so Musk and Dorsey are collaborators in some weird Mars cult, and don’t actually care about making money from Twitter?</strong></p><p>A: Yeah, you’re getting it. Musk also seems pretty interested in helping advance Putin’s “multipolar world order,” which is why he plays footsie with QAnon and MAGA accounts, and pals around with Putin and Dmitry Medvedev. “How are things going in Bakhmut?,” Musk asked Medvedev.</p><p><strong>Q: So this is why Musk has been so supportive of the Russians lately? I thought he was on Ukraine’s side, since he helped them out with Starlink?</strong></p><p>A: It’s best to look at Musk as a kind of power broker between multiple parties, including Ukraine and Russia. SpaceX was made possible by laws passed by Dana Rohrabacher, Putin’s favorite Congressman. He really doesn’t like the US government, the SEC, and our politicians, and all things considered, he’d probably prefer to replace all of it with an app — call it “X,” the everything app. Elon might say: <em>“Do we really need a government, or could everyone just vote with an app? Be honest.”</em></p><p><strong>Q: So Musk wants to overthrow governments, and Dorsey is helping?</strong></p><p>A: Don’t be so <em>dramatic. </em>Everyone knows that the only way to advance society is through technocracy. Musk’s grandfather, <a href=\"https://silview.media/2022/04/12/elon-musk-is-the-grandson-of-a-jewish-canadian-leader-of-the-technocracy-movement-openly-backed-by-masons-and-the-rockefellers/\">Joshua Haldeman</a>, was involved in the technocracy movement in Canada in the 1930’s and was arrested — because it was seen as a threat to the government. The philosopher <a href=\"https://www.russiapost.info/society/the_sorcerers_apprentices_postscript\">James Burnham</a> wrote in his 1941 book, “The Managerial Revolution” that society should be run by technical managers, not elected politicians. <a href=\"https://russiapost.info/society/the_sorcerers_apprentices\">Russian <em>“methodologists” and “political technologists”</em></a> concluded the same thing in the 1990’s when they realized that “democracy” would just lead to mob-rule by populists. Democracy, they concluded, must be <em>managed</em>. This is what <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/11/29/putins-great-patriotic-pseudoscience/\">Putin has concluded</a>, also.</p><p><strong>Q: So Putin, Musk, and Dorsey share the same vision?</strong></p><p>A: It’s complicated. All seem to think a “multipolar world” is a good thing, because after all, shouldn’t Russia get to do its thing and not be bothered by anyone else? That’s “free speech” and opposes “cancel culture,” right? So yeah, that’s aligned with Putin. But Putin himself doesn’t support free speech; his government censors wildly, but it <em>does</em> support speech that breaks the hegemony of the Western elites. As do Musk and friends. This is internally inconsistent.</p><p><strong>Q: Back to the money thing… won’t advertisers balk at all this potential chaos, and won’t Twitter’s business model suffer?</strong></p><p>A: Musk and the people backing all this are more interested in reshaping the global order than in earning fake “fiat currency.” Their real goal is to usher in “hard currency” and re-base global currencies around scarcity and physical assets. So no it really doesn’t matter much what happens to Twitter’s ad model in the meantime. It will probably do alright, and they can probably find other ways to make money, like adding in payments and weird Dogecoin schemes.</p><p><strong>Q: How is Twitter going to help them kill off fiat currency? You mean like replace the dollar as the world’s reserve currency?</strong></p><p>A: As the Russian “methodologists” will tell you, it’s incredibly important to control the information space if you want to alter the real world. As the world plunges deeper into war and economic chaos in 2023–2024, there are real (perceived) opportunities to advance cryptocurrencies and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-07/russian-billionaire-potanin-says-tokens-can-displace-crypto\">asset-backed tokens</a> to replace the dollar. Whether any of this is realistic or not remains to be seen, but this is what they’d like to pursue — Musk and his deal backers in particular. <em>[Update: Saudi Arabian Prince Alwaleed bin Talal </em><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/31/tech/murphy-saudi-musk-twitter-cfius/index.html\"><em>announced</em></a><em> he is the second largest shareholder in Twitter; Saudi Arabia has long </em><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-15/saudi-switch-to-yuan-seen-as-symbolic-not-true-threat-to-dollar\"><em>sought</em></a><em> to unseat the dollar as the reserve currency.]</em></p><p><strong>Q: So this is why Musk seemingly “overpaid” for Twitter? He and his backers want to use it as a tool of information warfare, to kill off the dollar and help usher in Putin’s “multipolar world?”</strong></p><p>A: Yes, that’s why they “overpaid” for Twitter. Because the end goals have nothing to do with Twitter or its ad model by itself. It’s merely a means to an end. Musk is likely to join forces with Trump’s Truth Social and Kanye West’s Parler to try to control much of the information space. And they’ve got the threat of Putin’s nukes to force the issue.</p><p><strong>Q: So isn’t Musk’s ownership of Twitter a national security risk? Shouldn’t the deal have been stopped on national security grounds?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, this is all a national security risk and the deal should probably have been stopped. The fact that it wasn’t is reflective of either fecklessness or capture of the US government.</p><p><strong>Q: Can Musk and his friends really do all this? Should we really be worried? It seems so far-fetched.</strong></p><p>A: That remains to be seen, and it’s unlikely they can achieve all they’d like to on the timeline they’d prefer. It will likely take years to make Bluesky into a viable product. However, just because it’s hard doesn’t mean they aren’t going to try. As for the broader anti-government agenda, as we’ve seen with January 6th and other attempts to challenge government, even unsuccessful efforts can be incredibly damaging. It’s worth monitoring the direction this takes and, the effects that it has on society and democracy.</p><p>A few other minor corrections to popular commentary on the deal:</p><ul><li><strong>Musk will just manipulate the stock price to make money. </strong>There is no more public-facing “stock price,” it’s a private company now. $TWTR is no longer a thing.</li><li><strong>Boy, Jack really screwed Elon by making him overpay.</strong> No, Jack basically asked Elon to buy the company and Elon set the price. Jack owned around <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2022/04/26/jack-dorsey-twitter-stock-ownership-net-worth-elon-musk/\">2.4%</a> of Twitter. It’s not clear if he even transacted his shares, or kept them. <em>[Update: Dorsey </em><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/jack-dorsey-saves-elon-musk-1billion-rolling-over-twitter-shares-2022-10\"><em>retained</em></a><em> his stake in Twitter, valued about $1 billion.]</em></li><li><strong>Parag is smarter than Elon, he forced him to overpay.</strong> Eh, I’m sure Parag did his job, but as CEO he was really responsible for operational concerns. It was the company’s Board and legal team that brought it to a successful close. Parag got his agreed-upon severance package.</li><li><strong>Elon never really wanted to do the deal… but they forced him. </strong>No, he wanted to do the deal all along, for the reasons I outlined. He might have liked to force some disclosures or lower the price. At some point, the delay and expense of potential litigation wasn’t worth it.</li></ul><p>For the record I think Elon is a sociopath, and that this all is going to end in disaster — I just couldn’t stand seeing so much shallow, poorly informed analysis proliferate. So I’ve done my best here to set the record straight.</p><p>Ultimately we are dealing with the fact that social engineering through control of the information environment is an inevitable reality—the only question is who has the means and moral authority to do it. (I’ve written a whitepaper about this set of concerns <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R_aVUrbAmkVXFF1vJWxnXE03FBtpxE8jkHF9P53n4Qk/edit\">here</a>.)</p><p>If democracy-minded people don’t seize control of the information environment, powerful sociopathic autocrats will do so instead. We leave a power vacuum open at our peril, and at the moment, Musk and Putin are the ones with the most will to fill it.</p><p><strong>For additional background:</strong> Read my piece <a href=\"https://washingtonspectator.org/paranoia-on-parade/\"><em>Paranoia on Parade: How Goldbugs, Libertarians and Religious Extremists Brought America to the Brink</em></a><em>, </em>which outlines many of the ideological and historical underpinnings of this movement.</p><p><em>I’ve known Jack Dorsey since 2007 and was the first external developer to utilize the Twitter API, for a </em><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2007/04/twittervision-o/\"><em>project</em></a><em> called Twittervision, which was featured in the Museum of Modern Art in 2008.

Whether any of this is realistic or not remains to be seen, but this is what they’d like to pursue — Musk and his deal backers in particular. <em>[Update: Saudi Arabian Prince Alwaleed bin Talal </em><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/31/tech/murphy-saudi-musk-twitter-cfius/index.html\"><em>announced</em></a><em> he is the second largest shareholder in Twitter; Saudi Arabia has long </em><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-15/saudi-switch-to-yuan-seen-as-symbolic-not-true-threat-to-dollar\"><em>sought</em></a><em> to unseat the dollar as the reserve currency.]</em></p><p><strong>Q: So this is why Musk seemingly “overpaid” for Twitter? He and his backers want to use it as a tool of information warfare, to kill off the dollar and help usher in Putin’s “multipolar world?”</strong></p><p>A: Yes, that’s why they “overpaid” for Twitter. Because the end goals have nothing to do with Twitter or its ad model by itself. It’s merely a means to an end. Musk is likely to join forces with Trump’s Truth Social and Kanye West’s Parler to try to control much of the information space. And they’ve got the threat of Putin’s nukes to force the issue.</p><p><strong>Q: So isn’t Musk’s ownership of Twitter a national security risk? Shouldn’t the deal have been stopped on national security grounds?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, this is all a national security risk and the deal should probably have been stopped. The fact that it wasn’t is reflective of either fecklessness or capture of the US government.</p><p><strong>Q: Can Musk and his friends really do all this? Should we really be worried? It seems so far-fetched.</strong></p><p>A: That remains to be seen, and it’s unlikely they can achieve all they’d like to on the timeline they’d prefer. It will likely take years to make Bluesky into a viable product. However, just because it’s hard doesn’t mean they aren’t going to try. As for the broader anti-government agenda, as we’ve seen with January 6th and other attempts to challenge government, even unsuccessful efforts can be incredibly damaging. It’s worth monitoring the direction this takes and, the effects that it has on society and democracy.</p><p>A few other minor corrections to popular commentary on the deal:</p><ul><li><strong>Musk will just manipulate the stock price to make money. </strong>There is no more public-facing “stock price,” it’s a private company now. $TWTR is no longer a thing.</li><li><strong>Boy, Jack really screwed Elon by making him overpay.</strong> No, Jack basically asked Elon to buy the company and Elon set the price. Jack owned around <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2022/04/26/jack-dorsey-twitter-stock-ownership-net-worth-elon-musk/\">2.4%</a> of Twitter. It’s not clear if he even transacted his shares, or kept them. <em>[Update: Dorsey </em><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/jack-dorsey-saves-elon-musk-1billion-rolling-over-twitter-shares-2022-10\"><em>retained</em></a><em> his stake in Twitter, valued about $1 billion.]</em></li><li><strong>Parag is smarter than Elon, he forced him to overpay.</strong> Eh, I’m sure Parag did his job, but as CEO he was really responsible for operational concerns. It was the company’s Board and legal team that brought it to a successful close. Parag got his agreed-upon severance package.</li><li><strong>Elon never really wanted to do the deal… but they forced him. </strong>No, he wanted to do the deal all along, for the reasons I outlined. He might have liked to force some disclosures or lower the price. At some point, the delay and expense of potential litigation wasn’t worth it.</li></ul><p>For the record I think Elon is a sociopath, and that this all is going to end in disaster — I just couldn’t stand seeing so much shallow, poorly informed analysis proliferate. So I’ve done my best here to set the record straight.</p><p>Ultimately we are dealing with the fact that social engineering through control of the information environment is an inevitable reality—the only question is who has the means and moral authority to do it. (I’ve written a whitepaper about this set of concerns <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R_aVUrbAmkVXFF1vJWxnXE03FBtpxE8jkHF9P53n4Qk/edit\">here</a>.)</p><p>If democracy-minded people don’t seize control of the information environment, powerful sociopathic autocrats will do so instead. We leave a power vacuum open at our peril, and at the moment, Musk and Putin are the ones with the most will to fill it.</p><p><strong>For additional background:</strong> Read my piece <a href=\"https://washingtonspectator.org/paranoia-on-parade/\"><em>Paranoia on Parade: How Goldbugs, Libertarians and Religious Extremists Brought America to the Brink</em></a><em>, </em>which outlines many of the ideological and historical underpinnings of this movement.</p><p><em>I’ve known Jack Dorsey since 2007 and was the first external developer to utilize the Twitter API, for a </em><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2007/04/twittervision-o/\"><em>project</em></a><em> called Twittervision, which was featured in the Museum of Modern Art in 2008.

This is why they defy, defile, and denigrate institutions at every opportunity. They simply do not expect consequences.</p><p>We have a serious problem on our hands, with deep roots. Russia and the GOP are the tip of the spear; China is the lever; Ukraine is a prelude to a much broader conflict. The US, UK, and each country has been engaged in navel-gazing worrying about its internal concerns instead of the bigger picture.</p><p>This is the same kind of failure to “connect dots” that preceded 9/11, and indeed this moment carries analogous themes and weight. But if we fail to address this, we will sleepwalk into a comparable disaster. Raise concern with your Congressperson; send them this article.</p><p>Media is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/10/18/gop-debt-ceiling-plan-financial-crisis-recession/\">catching on</a> that a deliberate financial disaster is being hatched; but they don’t know why or how, exactly, or the roots of this effort with Sachs, Stone, Gamble, Flynn, Bannon, Thornton, and their network. We need to close that gap.</p><p>The debt ceiling is also being used as a cudgel to cut budget for sending more aid to Ukraine. Much of the right-libertarian-owned GOP is, of course, Putin-aligned and will be happy to pursue this strategy to eliminate government and privatize… everything.</p><p>We don’t have much time. The US election is in 19 days; the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/10/20/world/liz-truss-news\">UK is in tatters</a>; if GOP takes the house they can follow Sachs’ “shock therapy” plan in January. Even if they don’t it could be a dangerous showdown. And it will be in the context of increasing chaos.</p><p>If the whole media ecosystem takes this information and runs with it, we may have a shot at avoiding a major showdown and possible collapse. If, as usual, folks wring their hands and equivocate, we will not change course.</p><p>Fascists create a crisis so they can then “solve” it.

Obviously, any nuclear provocations would only make this all worse.

In this video, Sacha and Sean talk about the end of state sovereignty; Sacha explicitly rejects the US constitution — “I don’t venerate it” — making his tours courting US “patriots” all the more concerning.</p><p>Expect Musk, Thiel, West, Trump, Flynn, Bannon, and their network in the US and UK to light up in support of this agenda. It’s a global wrenching against central banks and perceived “communism.” They’re trying to end it globally like Sachs did in the USSR, enabling Putin.</p><p>This network cares little about institutions or politics; they aim, like Clausewitz, to achieve through economic and information warfare that which cannot be achieved through politics. This is why they defy, defile, and denigrate institutions at every opportunity. They simply do not expect consequences.</p><p>We have a serious problem on our hands, with deep roots. Russia and the GOP are the tip of the spear; China is the lever; Ukraine is a prelude to a much broader conflict. The US, UK, and each country has been engaged in navel-gazing worrying about its internal concerns instead of the bigger picture.</p><p>This is the same kind of failure to “connect dots” that preceded 9/11, and indeed this moment carries analogous themes and weight. But if we fail to address this, we will sleepwalk into a comparable disaster. Raise concern with your Congressperson; send them this article.</p><p>Media is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/10/18/gop-debt-ceiling-plan-financial-crisis-recession/\">catching on</a> that a deliberate financial disaster is being hatched; but they don’t know why or how, exactly, or the roots of this effort with Sachs, Stone, Gamble, Flynn, Bannon, Thornton, and their network. We need to close that gap.</p><p>The debt ceiling is also being used as a cudgel to cut budget for sending more aid to Ukraine. Much of the right-libertarian-owned GOP is, of course, Putin-aligned and will be happy to pursue this strategy to eliminate government and privatize… everything.</p><p>We don’t have much time. The US election is in 19 days; the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/10/20/world/liz-truss-news\">UK is in tatters</a>; if GOP takes the house they can follow Sachs’ “shock therapy” plan in January. Even if they don’t it could be a dangerous showdown. And it will be in the context of increasing chaos.</p><p>If the whole media ecosystem takes this information and runs with it, we may have a shot at avoiding a major showdown and possible collapse. If, as usual, folks wring their hands and equivocate, we will not change course.</p><p>Fascists create a crisis so they can then “solve” it. Every <a href=\"https://wwnorton.com/books/strongmen\">student of fascism</a> will tell you this is part of the playbook. Sachs and friends are pushing for collapse so a new “multipolar world order” can be ushered in.</p><p>It may seem counterintuitive that “capitalists” would expose themselves to such risk and losses. Think again. Fiat money is fake to them.

We’ll also be publishing long-form pieces requiring more time to assemble (like the recent <a href=\"https://washingtonspectator.org/paranoia-on-parade/\"><em>Paranoia On Parade</em></a>) in <em>The Spectator.</em></p><p>Our goal is to create a feedback loop with readers, and allow you to more readily participate in our investigative work. “Call me trimtab,” as Bucky Fuller used to say:</p><blockquote>“Something hit me very hard once, thinking about what one little man could do. Think of the Queen Elizabeth again: The whole ship goes by and then comes the rudder. And there’s a tiny thing on the edge of the rudder called a trim tab. It’s a miniature rudder. <strong>Just moving that little trim tab builds a low pressure that pulls the rudder around. It takes almost no effort at all. So I said that the individual can be a trim tab.</strong> Society thinks it’s going right by you, that it’s left you altogether. <strong>But if you’re doing dynamic things mentally, the fact is that you can just put your foot out like that and the whole ship of state is going to turn around. So I said, ‘Call me Trim Tab.’“</strong></blockquote><blockquote>“The truth is that you get the low pressure to do things, rather than getting on the other side and trying to push the bow of the ship around. And you build that low pressure by getting rid of a little nonsense, getting rid of things that don’t work and aren’t true until you start to get that trim-tab motion. It works every time. That’s the grand strategy you’re going for.</blockquote><p>We hope that this modest feedback loop builds into a great wave that may ultimately help turn the ships of state in a more constructive and sustainable direction.</p><p><strong>New Episodes of “Dave Troy Presents…”<br></strong>Speaking of Bucky Fuller, I was honored to interview Alec Nevala-Lee, author of “Inventor of the Future,” his excellent new biography of Fuller — a complex character who inspired all manner of shenanigans which we’ll be exploring in future reporting.</p><p>Recent episodes have covered a range of related topics including Libertarian Exit with Raymond B. Craib, The Cult of Bucky Fuller with Alec Nevala-Lee, and The Mysteries of Eurasia with Joe Szimhart.

That <a href=\"https://washingtonspectator.org/paranoia-on-parade/\">story</a>, <em>“Paranoia on Parade: How Goldbugs, Libertarians and Religious Extremists Brought America to the Brink”</em> was published this week as a lead feature, along with a 3-part podcast series that features the story along with extra commentary.</p><p>In the words of <em>Washington Spectator</em> editor Hamilton Fish:</p><blockquote>Dave Troy’s masterful essay <a href=\"https://washingtonspectator.org/paranoia-on-parade/\"><em>Paranoia on Parade</em></a><em> </em>highlights our May-June issue. Against the backdrop of the January 6 Committee hearings, Troy traces the roots of the insurrection to the wealthy industrialists, oil barons and tech entrepreneurs and whose century-long crusade to dismantle the government and assert control over the currency wound up on the Capitol steps.</blockquote><blockquote>Opponents of the New Deal and leaders of the American business community looked to European fascism for models that would enable them to thwart social democracy and the democratization of America. They recruited aggrieved veterans, conservative Christians, anti-communists, anti-Semites and white nationalists to their cause, one that ultimately failed to excite a nation in thrall to Roosevelt’s program.</blockquote><blockquote>After WW I, industrialists called for the gold standard, which would protect their wealth from the corrosive effects of inflation and prevent governmental expansion at a time of national economic crisis; right-wing business and political interests aligned in the John Birch Society; in Texas the Hunt family hoarded silver, and later assorted ex-military and extreme right-wing fortune hunters chased rumors of Filipino gold; and the allure of the new world of crypto caused a stir in a culture gone mad for anything digital. The protagonists all shared the goal of easing the currency out from under government oversight and control, and the whole paranoid circus, their disciples, descendants and derivatives, in one guise or another, converged on Washington on January 6.</blockquote><p>This longform piece is, I think, the most important thing I’ve ever written.

That <a href=\"https://washingtonspectator.org/paranoia-on-parade/\">story</a>, <em>“Paranoia on Parade: How Goldbugs, Libertarians and Religious Extremists Brought America to the Brink”</em> was published this week as a lead feature, along with a 3-part podcast series that features the story along with extra commentary.</p><p>In the words of <em>Washington Spectator</em> editor Hamilton Fish:</p><blockquote>Dave Troy’s masterful essay <a href=\"https://washingtonspectator.org/paranoia-on-parade/\"><em>Paranoia on Parade</em></a><em> </em>highlights our May-June issue. Against the backdrop of the January 6 Committee hearings, Troy traces the roots of the insurrection to the wealthy industrialists, oil barons and tech entrepreneurs and whose century-long crusade to dismantle the government and assert control over the currency wound up on the Capitol steps.</blockquote><blockquote>Opponents of the New Deal and leaders of the American business community looked to European fascism for models that would enable them to thwart social democracy and the democratization of America. They recruited aggrieved veterans, conservative Christians, anti-communists, anti-Semites and white nationalists to their cause, one that ultimately failed to excite a nation in thrall to Roosevelt’s program.</blockquote><blockquote>After WW I, industrialists called for the gold standard, which would protect their wealth from the corrosive effects of inflation and prevent governmental expansion at a time of national economic crisis; right-wing business and political interests aligned in the John Birch Society; in Texas the Hunt family hoarded silver, and later assorted ex-military and extreme right-wing fortune hunters chased rumors of Filipino gold; and the allure of the new world of crypto caused a stir in a culture gone mad for anything digital. The protagonists all shared the goal of easing the currency out from under government oversight and control, and the whole paranoid circus, their disciples, descendants and derivatives, in one guise or another, converged on Washington on January 6.</blockquote><p>This longform piece is, I think, the most important thing I’ve ever written. It is my attempt to make sense of what’s gotten us here, through the lens of paranoid politics — in the sense of the term coined by Richard Hofstadter in his landmark 1964 <a href=\"https://harpers.org/archive/1964/11/the-paranoid-style-in-american-politics/\">essay</a> <em>“The Paranoid Style in American Politics”</em>—covering 1933–2022.</p><p>It’s a wild story, covering everything from goldbugs, the “I AM” cult, to Birchers, QAnon, cryptocurrency, and January 6th — and importantly, asserts they are all expressions of a single unified reactionary phenomenon.</p><p><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dave-troy-presents/id1610914569?i=1000568005072\">‎Dave Troy Presents: Paranoia On Parade, Part 1: The \"Directors Cut\" with Jack Bryan and Hamilton Fish on Apple Podcasts</a></p><p>Since it’s a long piece (~12,000 words) I spent last week recording an audio version, with commentary, with my friend Jack Bryan.

Here’s how to escape. (Photo: howstuffworks.com)</figcaption></figure><p>There is a nearly foolproof plan underway to crush the United States and bring it fully under fascist rule. In recent months, this chorus has been on repeat:</p><ol><li><strong><em>“Federal overspending has pushed inflation to new levels.”</em></strong> This claim, which is not backed up with data, connects two <em>facts</em> in a misleading way. Yes, the Federal government, under Trump and Biden, authorized significant stimulus spending to help with the severest effects of the pandemic. These efforts were mostly successful. And while there has been significant inflation over the last year, there isn’t much evidence to suggest that COVID stimulus <em>did in fact lead to inflation.</em></li><li><strong><em>“Gas prices are too high, hurting everyday people at the pump. And it’s Biden’s fault.”</em> </strong>Yes, gas prices are very high — in every country in the world — places where Biden is not president. Regardless of whether gas <em>should</em> be as cheap as it was (we need to get off of it entirely), we certainly are dependent on it now. So this has real-world effects for everyday Americans, but importantly the <em>costs of all goods.</em> Including food. But oil and gas companies are realizing record profits, suggesting that high prices are not a result of supply shortage, but rather <a href=\"https://novelscience.substack.com/p/what-to-know-about-gas-prices-whats?s=w\">discretionary profit-taking</a>.</li><li><strong><em>“The Fed needs to raise interest rates to keep inflation in check, since it lost control of the economy.”</em></strong> This is another logical fallacy. Arguably, near-zero interest rates were not a great thing for the economy anyway, and we saw a lot of speculative bubbles (like the entire crypto market, more on that later) arise from this policy. But the Fed can raise interest rates to 10% and it won’t make a damn bit of difference to fuel prices, which are <em>actually behind the inflation.</em></li><li><strong><em>“Wow, the Fed sure is raising interest rates aggressively and nothing is getting better… this is going to kill the economy.” </em></strong>This is because the inflation is coming primarily from profit-taking in the energy sector and supply chain imbalances, things that will remain unaffected by interest rate hikes. We are being goaded into treating a symptom that will explicitly not address the disease.</li><li><strong><em>“Looks like Joe Biden’s overspending led us right into a recession, just like we said it would. Mass unemployment can’t be far behind.”</em></strong> Nevermind that unemployment is at all-time lows… this recession that Biden caused is certainly going to lead to doom and gloom! Good thing the oil and gas companies made record profits throughout all of this — but let’s not mention that!</li></ol><p>These false assertions, repeated ad infinitum from every possible media outlet, will <em>guarantee</em> that Democrats lose control of Congress in November. Whatever else people think will motivate voters, pushing fuel and food prices to the point of civil unrest will make it impossible for any other issue to matter. November will be a referendum on energy prices and food prices. Banks are <a href=\"https://bylinetimes.com/2022/05/17/global-banks-privately-prepare-for-dangerous-levels-of-imminent-civil-unrest-in-western-homelands/\">already planning</a> for civil unrest, according to a report obtained by the <em>Byline Times</em>.</p><p>This is all, well, really bad, and is going to lead to a lot of pain. But it could have been worse. Parts of their otherwise solid plan to push the economy into disarray are not going as well.</p><p>Here’s what the historical fascist international network hoped would also happen:</p><ul><li><strong><em>That Bitcoin would be a hedge against inflation.</em></strong> That didn’t happen at all. Bitcoin and all crypto have <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/13/cramer-dubs-bitcoin-collapse-crypto-monday-says-many-tech-execs-call-it-a-con.html\">behaved</a> as a speculative risk-on asset and as interest rates have gone up, crypto assets have come under increasing pressure and begun to collapse, especially as leveraged positions are unwound. Austrian Economics folklore and prophecy suggests that Bitcoin <em>should</em> have gone way up against inflation… but it just didn’t happen that way. That’s because Austrian Economics is mostly bullshit, and it’s about time its adherents got some real-world empirical data shoved down their gullets with prejudice.</li></ul><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ozqkYsknWPD90gtV7eQSHg.png\" /><figcaption>The <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/dxy\">DXY</a> Dollar Index: The Dollar is strong relative to other currencies.</figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong><em>That the dollar would collapse relative to other currencies, threatening its status as the world’s reserve currency.</em></strong> That also failed to materialize. In fact, the dollar is very strong relative to other currencies, and all of the schemes that Russia had to try to undermine the dollar in oil transactions (whether using rubles or gold) have gone poorly and met with resistance.</li></ul><p>So while these things didn’t work out, some other things are also in the works. Because this is a global war, the fascists are aligned in common cause:</p><ul><li><strong><em>Putin will cut off food exports from Ukraine, commandeering grain for his own use.</em></strong><em> </em>This is going to have the effect of starving Ukrainians as well as all the countries that depend on Ukrainian grain exports for food. This includes much of the developing world, in Africa and elsewhere, but will also affect food prices globally.</li><li><strong><em>Importantly, this will spark </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-61685383\"><strong><em>outflows of refugees from Africa</em></strong></a><strong><em> into Europe, exacerbating immigration tensions there and further straining available resources to absorb such flows.</em></strong> Putin has weaponized the flow of refugees <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-weaponizing-syrian-refugees-geopolitical-goals/27562604.html\">repeatedly in the past</a> and he will not hesitate to do it again. It is key to his strategy and we should expect it.</li></ul><p>The goal will be to induce as much chaos as possible in the US and in Europe so that support for Ukraine will become a distant concern and attention will turn to fuel and food costs, civil unrest, and accelerating violence. In chaos born from that context, authoritarian strongmen like Desantis and his <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-tweets-leans-toward-150244806.html\">new backer, Elon Musk</a>, can swoop into offer “solutions.” This is where we are headed. Bet on it.</p><h3>How to Stop This</h3><p>The key to this plan is to keep energy prices as high as possible, so that inflation stays high and there is a constant call to raise interest rates beyond the point of any utility, sparking a severe recession.</p><p>One solution is to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-energy-biden-dpa-idUSW1N2X201Y?scrolltoken=jhiUkqGSGKjn_xkVdZcmXORUMOsOb6Rf488W6xN3LojuljkmVpRVcDmFqNBlc9eS3Jaf6mK8H8KUf4Lz9dSkxPc6YmhN93Z4TWHmFN41JUl6xPxPRdwPUf_rXtLA0j2ia-KKgyXcJ_xWtZ2PrK-v6Ag_os7nwjrdoJj4bh2YzXxsHhNeoC493CUDoiQOY02m3e57XtDmbC26EYi_M3F7yLJp2is.eyJraWQiOiIzIn0\">seize control of the oil+gas and energy sectors under the Defense Production Act</a>, and ensure that fuel flows freely and without any excessive discretionary profit-taking. Steps in this direction are apparently already underway, and that’s good. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/03/opinion/gas-prices-russia-opec.html\">Another solution</a> is to challenge the oil cartels with lawsuits. Any challenge to the energy sector is helpful.</p><h3>E Rosalie on Twitter: \"6/ In May 2022 a report on meat industry earnings stated: \"Company data from Tyson Foods indicates that the meat processing giant used its size and power to extract an additional $500 million from American(s) under the cover of inflation.\" https://t.co/g8TmkvIzbZ / Twitter\"</h3><p>6/ In May 2022 a report on meat industry earnings stated: \"Company data from Tyson Foods indicates that the meat processing giant used its size and power to extract an additional $500 million from American(s) under the cover of inflation.\" https://t.co/g8TmkvIzbZ</p><p>Ultimately the energy and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NovelSci/status/1537189889174798337?s=20&t=Vw0nFRUDxVtLHiMyL7gy9A\">food markets</a> are not true free markets that result in competition, but actually function as cartels that collude to fix prices in an effort to achieve geopolitical goals.

(René Magritte)</figcaption></figure><p>This week I was in the beautiful city of Brussels, Belgium meeting up with friends and colleagues — many of whom I hadn’t seen in over two years. It was a great opportunity to reset, gain some wisdom, and also learn more about what’s going on in information warfare globally. I attended the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensics Lab <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/programs/digital-forensic-research-lab/360os/360os-2022/#register\">360/Open Summit</a> event, which included a wide range of experts including US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Nobel Peace Prize Winner Maria Ressa.</p><p>I was able to synthesize an assessment of where things might go, in combination with my own views and research, and, well… it’s not pretty. But there are things we can do, and reasons to have hope. Here’s a rough overview of what we might expect:</p><ul><li><strong>Putin will weaponize food shortages, inflation, fuel prices, and refugee flows.</strong> As fuel prices rise, so will food prices. This will cause widespread starvation in Africa, which will launch a flow of refugees from Africa into Europe, similar to what happened in 2015 but at a larger scale. This will trigger all manner of xenophobia in Europe and help weaken resolve. Germany, France, Italy, Turkey, and Hungary are already wobbly with respect to Ukraine support, for a variety of historical reasons. (Remnants of the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact, Italian north-south rivalries, and a longing for the restoration of the Austro-Hungarian empire loom large, and just beneath the surface). Ukraine and Europe are also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/10/were-almost-out-of-ammunition-and-relying-on-western-arms-says-ukraine?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Other\">running out of ammunition</a>, making the conflict entirely dependent on US supplies against Russia and China supplies.</li><li><strong>It never was about NATO, and there is no off-ramp.</strong> Yesterday, Putin made a speech wherein he <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/09/world/europe/putin-peter-the-great.html\">likened himself to Peter the Great</a>, and suggested that Russia’s action in Ukraine was merely a case of Russia reclaiming what was rightfully theirs. He is a Tsarist, and aims to recapture or colonize any territory that suits his imagination.</li><li><strong>The United States may descend into civil unrest, or revolution.</strong> Oil and gas cartels may push fuel prices as high as $10 per gallon in the US. This would clearly signify a new high-water mark and could usher in a wave of civil unrest. Biden will be blamed for this, even though fuel prices will rise globally, and it has nothing to do with him. Food prices will likewise go up dramatically, as there is little practical difference between food and fuel (both are energy). Banks are predicting that middle class Americans may have trouble paying for essentials like food and fuel, and are planning for ‘imminent’ and unprecedented civil unrest, according to a <a href=\"https://bylinetimes.com/2022/05/17/global-banks-privately-prepare-for-dangerous-levels-of-imminent-civil-unrest-in-western-homelands/\">report obtained by The Byline Times</a>. Given that this would help fulfill goals of the fascist international, we should expect that Republicans and their allies will be pushing this forward at every opportunity.</li><li><strong>Ukraine war will become a years-long war of attrition.</strong> Putin will use chaos in Europe and the US to undermine support for Ukraine and continue to throw raw resources and personnel, despite lack of training, at wearing down the situation there. A low-yield nuclear strike against targets in Western Ukraine is a distinct possibility — perhaps Lviv, which would limit easterly fallout affecting Russia — and would have the effect of activating “anti-war” activists in Europe and the US. This “Fifth Column” could be very effective given this new demonstration of force (and lack of judgment) in eroding continued support for Ukraine.</li><li><strong>If Ukraine falls, the Baltics, Poland, and Balkans will be the next targets.</strong> Russia can only be stopped if it is unequivocally defeated. If it is not, it will regroup (with its allies China and India) and resume information warfare then kinetic warfare against all its adjacent territories. The Baltics are very clearly in its sights already and will be attacked without question, unless stopped. Poland and much of the Balkan states are not far behind. While this may sound implausible because of how weak Russia seems right now, it is thinking in terms of the ~3 billion people represented by Russia, China, India, Brazil (et al) vs. the ~1 billion people represented by NATO. While that’s an apples to oranges comparison, the overall scales involved make the matching more even than it might seem on the surface.</li><li><strong>China may become more aggressive as it faces internal threats.</strong> China faces a demographic bomb as its population ages. Its single child policy means an elderly population will soon be gone, and it will face a shrinking population. China’s GDP is heavily dependent (around 30%) on overhyped real-estate schemes, many of which will never be occupied. The conflict with Taiwan continues to simmer and will eventually come to a head, creating a strategic threat against global production of integrated circuit chips. China is beginning to become more aggressive with its information warfare, and starting to <a href=\"https://nationalinterest.org/blog/reboot/china-threatens-australia-missile-attack-199667\">threaten Australia</a>. The historic Kuomintang network which seems to be associated with Guo Wengui and Steve Bannon is preparing itself as “shock troops” to take over when the CCP falls. While that may be fantasy, the situation definitely has elements of instability that should be closely monitored.</li><li><strong>Russia is increasing its aggression towards Japan over the Kuril Islands.</strong> The islands in Northern Japan, an important fishing ground, have been contested since World War II. Russia is threatening Japan, suggesting that it will return the islands to their control if Tokyo distances itself from the United States and the West. <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/npfp/russia-and-japan-different-wavelengths-kuril-islands\">So far, this play has not been working</a>, but they are continuing to become ever more aggressive in pushing Japan in this direction. Aleksandr Dugin sees Japan as part of the Russian sphere of influence and wishes to drive Japan apart from Western influence.</li><li><strong>We are dealing with a resurgence of individualism and propertarianism.</strong> Whether talking about “sovereign citizen” lunacy, or “sovereign individual” bitcoin fantasies, the propertarian legacy of slave ownership, or gold fetishists in Vienna longing for the restoration of the Austro-Hungarian empire, we are dealing with a resurgence of interest in hierarchy and its very close cousins, white supremacy and eugenics. The idea that money confers reproductive fitness is a recurring theme, even as it is nonsense, and we should be prepared, once again, to combat it.</li><li><strong>In the end, this resolves to one key conflict: carbon fuels.</strong> Carbon fuel producers <em>really</em> don’t want to stop producing carbon fuel; they have massive, long term investments they wish to productively amortize over a decades or centuries. Pesky democracies that want to shut down the party now are ultimately a minor annoyance. Converting energy flows into influence — by purchasing politicians, organizations, and capturing government — is straightforward enough, and simply a matter of positioning the right marketing campaigns, politicians, and cults in service of the task. Influence is 20th century technology perfected by the marriage with 21st century finance and technology. And the kicker? The best way to capture a government is to eliminate it. Obviously, the need to address anthropogenic climate change is real, and is impeded by the capture or elimination of government.</li><li><strong>Some have already decided that climate isn’t fixable, or wish to rely on techno-solutionism, to address our dilemma.</strong> “<a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/why-longtermism-is-the-worlds-most-dangerous-secular-credo\">Longtermist</a>” followers of Nick Bostrom have proposed that the near-term fate of humans on earth isn’t as important as the eventual fate of <em>all</em> humans, i.e. the human species. From this perspective, tending to the poor or the climate or any immediate challenge we face is foolish in comparison to the importance of becoming a so-called “multi-planetary species.” Elon Musk, his pal Grimes, Jack Dorsey and Peter Thiel seem to be exhibiting signs of internalizing this philosophy.</li><li><strong>The January 6th hearings are not going to have a noticeable effect on any of this — even as it’s helpful for the public, journalists and historians to develop an accurate historical record of what happened.</strong> Many in the US are expecting big developments from the January 6th Committee Hearings. This is probably misplaced, especially from a global perspective. Besides for establishing a political narrative that the Republican Party has engaged in a long-term effort to overthrow democracies in the US and elsewhere — a fact that has been well established and long-known — it is unclear whether this will meaningfully move public opinion. And again, I say this not to be discouraging, but rather to encourage folks to think more broadly and creatively in terms of how we might counter this. From a governance perspective, it’s very good that the committee is laying out the details of the conspiracy to overthrow the government. <em>This is what constitutional democracies should do, and we must do this to demonstrate clearly that we still aspire to be one.</em> But it is unclear what effects, if any, these hearings may have on people who do not believe anything wrong took place that day. For that reason, advocates for democracy should also stay focused on current emerging threats and the ongoing undermining of democracy by people like Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, and their allies in the fascist international — not least, the emerging alliance between Russia, India, China, and Brazil. The gambit to overthrow pluralistic democracies didn’t begin or end on January 6th and is very much still ongoing.</li><li><strong>Musk will complete the Twitter deal, most likely. </strong>Musk has become an avatar for a network of global fascists. He’s already found a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-09/musk-twitter-bid-counts-secretive--5-billion-fund-among-backers\">syndicate of backers</a> for the Twitter deal and is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/08/technology/twitter-musk-firehose-tweets.html\">going through motions</a> to satisfy his complaint about bots. He’s also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davetroy/status/1534938078384635905?s=20&t=vnCu_Jlxrb0GY7a3zNEjEg\">started</a>, apparently, to talk about acquiring the OANN cable news channel. We should expect this same global fascist syndicate to provide the funding (and ideological backing) for this effort, and for goals to be aligned between Twitter and OANN — a bizarre and terrifying thought. The US should be looking to potentially oppose these moves on national security, anti-trust, and FARA grounds.</li></ul><p>So we are faced now with a dilemma. How do we fight forces resistant to institutional power using institutions? Arguably, we cannot; it is necessary, but not necessarily sufficient. That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t use every institutional mechanism that we can, but we need leadership that articulates and is almost uncomfortably honest about our current situation.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZnM4SzYHMyavVOB0hDckgg.png\" /><figcaption>Imagination: Paintings by René Magritte (Musée René Magritte, Brussels)</figcaption></figure><ol><li><strong>We must admit that our institutions are under systemic attack.</strong> From capture of the legislature and the courts to the dismantling of executive agencies, there is no surface of our federal government that isn’t besieged. The goal is to build a bottom-up challenge to the US Government drawing from the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/12/17/constitutional-sheriffs-extremist-dangerous-unconstitutional/\">Constitutional Sheriffs</a> movement.</li><li><strong>Cultivate imagination in all its forms.</strong> Everything being done to undermine our democracy is a product of long-term, imaginative designs meant to work both institutionally and extra-institutionally to exercise raw power and dismantle the government. Imagination is a strategic asset and we should be thinking as creatively as possible (while remaining inside the law, obviously — even as that’s not a constraint for the opposition). Still, there is an endless reservoir of wildly imaginative counters that can be mounted that can put opponents on their back foot and force them to react. Use them in every possible way, and cultivate participation from every sector of society, from regular people to artists to business-people.</li><li><strong>Demonstrate leadership — and articulate and amplify simple, clear, and honest messaging.</strong> Leadership is everything right now, and we have many good elected ones. But we also have leaders in business, in public service, in education, in non-profits, and the arts. Step up, raise your voice, and help <em>lead</em>. Not to grandstand, but to be part of the <em>team</em> that helps expose and counter exactly what’s happening now. Everyone can help. If you have particularly strong ideas, work to get them in front of people. My friend, a software engineer named Stephen Diehl, recently exemplified this kind of leadership by developing a clear message from technologists about the risks posed by cryptocurrencies. The <a href=\"https://concerned.tech\">letter</a>, signed by regular people (including myself), <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/06/03/crypto-skeptics-growing/\">caught the eye of the press</a> and has been amplified beyond his wildest expectations. We all have that kind of power, if we try.</li></ol><p>You may recall after September 11, many concluded that it was the product of a “failure of imagination.” That is true; we failed to piece together information that could have resulted in the plot being foiled.</p><p>But speaking more broadly, it is a lack of imagination that has led us into being vulnerable to attack after attack. To quote the inimitable Hunter S. Thompson, “When the going gets weird, the weird turn pro.” We are dealing with so much professional weirdness — which itself is calcifying into a kind of brittle rigidity—it’s time we get as weird as possible in response. As the world melts down, we will increasingly be called to cultivate the strange in opposition to evil.</p><p><em>We’re interested in the major historical trends that shape current events. Tips?

Imagination is a strategic asset and we should be thinking as creatively as possible (while remaining inside the law, obviously — even as that’s not a constraint for the opposition). Still, there is an endless reservoir of wildly imaginative counters that can be mounted that can put opponents on their back foot and force them to react. Use them in every possible way, and cultivate participation from every sector of society, from regular people to artists to business-people.</li><li><strong>Demonstrate leadership — and articulate and amplify simple, clear, and honest messaging.</strong> Leadership is everything right now, and we have many good elected ones. But we also have leaders in business, in public service, in education, in non-profits, and the arts. Step up, raise your voice, and help <em>lead</em>. Not to grandstand, but to be part of the <em>team</em> that helps expose and counter exactly what’s happening now. Everyone can help. If you have particularly strong ideas, work to get them in front of people. My friend, a software engineer named Stephen Diehl, recently exemplified this kind of leadership by developing a clear message from technologists about the risks posed by cryptocurrencies. The <a href=\"https://concerned.tech\">letter</a>, signed by regular people (including myself), <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/06/03/crypto-skeptics-growing/\">caught the eye of the press</a> and has been amplified beyond his wildest expectations. We all have that kind of power, if we try.</li></ol><p>You may recall after September 11, many concluded that it was the product of a “failure of imagination.” That is true; we failed to piece together information that could have resulted in the plot being foiled.</p><p>But speaking more broadly, it is a lack of imagination that has led us into being vulnerable to attack after attack. To quote the inimitable Hunter S. Thompson, “When the going gets weird, the weird turn pro.” We are dealing with so much professional weirdness — which itself is calcifying into a kind of brittle rigidity—it’s time we get as weird as possible in response. As the world melts down, we will increasingly be called to cultivate the strange in opposition to evil.</p><p><em>We’re interested in the major historical trends that shape current events. Tips?

This power, rooted in Russian Orthodoxy and Eurasianism, has meant doing obscene things that achieve <em>effects.</em> Nothing, not nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons, is outside consideration if they achieve desired effects. The NATO alliance has become stronger for now; will that be true in the case of a nuclear strike of a specific design?</li><li><strong>Traditionalism.</strong> Never before has the Supreme Court taken away a right it had previously granted. We seem now to be moving backwards. 100 years of progress for women has been halted; between the <em>Roe</em> decision, baby formula shortages, non-stop attacks on women, and metastatic misogyny, there is a welling tide of traditionalism accelerating the subjugation of women. Battles over “Great Replacement Theory” (which is an ancient idea) and “Critical Race Theory” serve to tear down institutions, as people die from the conflict.</li><li><strong>Elon Musk.</strong> Nothing Elon Musk is doing makes any real business sense for Tesla, Twitter, or SpaceX, and we shouldn’t try to evaluate it that way. It’s clear he’s dropped out of the realm of the rational and into a deeper mission — indeed his own “Mission”—which is centered on making humans an interplanetary species. Musk has become a master of “manifesting” realities he wishes to inhabit. He intends to use Twitter to drive network effects to manifest the reality he wants. That is a fundamentally occult idea, but it comes in conflict with governments, rules, and institutions. So he’s seeking to eliminate them, starting with the SEC.</li><li><strong>SEC and the Fifth Circuit.</strong> On May 18, the 5th Circuit court ruled 2–1 that the Securities and Exchange Commission has no Constitutional authority to adjudicate its own rule enforcement actions. Many people have read this as a refutation of the ability of the SEC to even make rules at all. Congress has the exclusive right to draft laws, and some argue that right cannot be delegated to federal agencies. Since the New Deal, courts have broadly upheld the sensible idea that that authority can be delegated to career specialists within government. The most recent case, <em>Jarkesy & Patriot28 LLC vs. Securities and Exchange Commission,</em> was brought by a Tea Party activist. The judges that decided the case are connected to the Federalist Society. When this goes to the Supreme Court, as it surely will, what will the Federalist Society judges there do? This case could lead the way to the dismantling of <em>all</em> federal agencies, from the IRS, SEC, and EPA, to the FCC and FDA. Again—backwards, and into the darkness.</li><li><strong>Elections.</strong> Every effort is being made to dismantle elections and remove power from voters. There are people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/22/pennsylvania-josh-shapiro-democrat-republican-rival-doug-mastriano\">documenting</a> this in excruciating detail, and I won’t bother to recap it all here, but everything from local, state, and federal elections are at risk. We cannot necessarily count on elections <em>even taking place</em>, much less being able to achieve the outcomes we seek. The very notion of <em>peaceful transfer of power</em> is presently at risk, and we should act like it.</li><li><strong>Dark MAGA and Civil War.<em> </em></strong>Increasingly, we’re hearing calls for “civil war” (from <a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/trump-shares-post-suggesting-civil-003103426.html\">Trump</a> and <a href=\"https://jimstewartson.substack.com/p/-mike-flynn-explicitly-endorses-violent?s=r\">Flynn</a>) and for “<a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/defeat-cawthorn-says-dark-maga-must-take-command-rcna29781\">dark MAGA to take command</a>” (from the “defeated” Madison Cawthorn). We should not give charlatans more credit than due, but the fact is that these bad actors are tapping into some dark cultural forces. All three are “out of power” and yet wielding tremendous cultural power with their adherents. See how that works? Does one need to be “in office” in order to drive us all to the dark side? Steve Bannon doesn’t think so. And Elon Musk and Andrew Yang suggest that we must end the “two party system” now. And… do what?</li><li><strong>Imminent Civil Unrest and Energy Price Spikes.</strong> I don’t know whether we’ll have unrest soon or not, and indeed I hope we do not.

Russia continues to expend resources in a war of attrition that stands to destabilize the country.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/770/1*EDCmhIZt7hW24L2fF1ko5Q.png\" /><figcaption>Fascist aesthetics on display.

Many have speculated that Russia may announce a full-blown war on Ukraine tomorrow, a move which could escalate violence and pull in conscripts from across Russia and its client states. The conflict may also escalate to include so-called “nazis” globally, including within NATO countries. And it’s true, some kind of escalation feels inevitable; Putin’s current approach simply isn’t sustainable. Today, US first lady <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/ukraine-us-first-lady-jill-biden-makes-surprise-visit-to-ukraine-live-updates/a-61721480\">Jill Biden</a> and the band <a href=\"https://www.rte.ie/news/ukraine/2022/0508/1296762-bono-ukraine-latest/\">U2</a> are visiting Kyiv, which feels almost like a provocation to Russia. Recent reports that US intelligence has been <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/05/us/politics/moskva-russia-ship-ukraine-us.html\">feeding targeting data</a> to Ukraine have made headlines, which serve to further taunt Putin. While these actions serve to diminish Russian morale, we should also expect they may enrage Putin and his inner circle.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/05/us/politics/moskva-russia-ship-ukraine-us.html\">U.S. Intelligence Helped Ukraine Strike Russian Flagship, Officials Say</a></p><p>Russia celebrates May 9th, the anniversary of the date on which the Red Army helped to defeat the Nazis in Berlin, annually, with a massive military parade. Of course, the celebration is based on a lie: World War II (or “The Great Patriotic War” as it has been known in Russia) was co-authored by Stalin, the victory over the Nazis was a result of the efforts of the Allies, and the Red Army notoriously <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_during_the_occupation_of_Germany\">raped</a> its way across Berlin before Hitler finally <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Adolf_Hitler\">shot himself</a> on April 30, 1945. Regardless, Putin will celebrate “Victory Day” tomorrow with a massive parade and show of equipment — even if it’s just cardboard cutouts. It’s unclear what gear Russia’s military can afford to withhold from its Ukraine campaign, beset as it is with equipment and materiel shortages and ongoing <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-suffers-another-fire-at-a-supply-depot-as-its-ukraine-offensive-pushes-west-11651057494\">destruction</a> and sabotage of its supply chain.</p><h3>What We Might Expect</h3><p>Russia has ramped up its nuclear rhetoric to unprecedented levels. It has threatened to <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/next/2022/05/04/what-is-russia-s-poseidon-nuclear-drone-and-could-it-wipe-out-the-uk-in-a-radioactive-tsun\">drown Britain</a> in a radioactive tsunami set off by a nuclear warhead delivered via drone. <a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/putin-rather-press-nuclear-button-lose-ukraine-war-rt-broadcaster-151707840.html\">Margarita Simonyan</a> (or as I call her, Marge) has offered that Russia has two options: losing its Ukraine war, or embarking on “World War III.” Of the two, she sees the latter as more likely. “We’re all going to do die someday,” she offered, comfortingly.</p><p>More recently, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexei Zaitsev <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/world/russia-says-it-wont-use-nuclear-weapons-in-ukraine\">said</a> that recent rhetoric is overblown and that Russia will not use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, and that “there can be no winners in a nuclear war.”</p><p>The only North Star when dealing with Russia is that they can never be counted on to tell the truth, but they often give hints about what they may do. My opinion is that neither NATO or Russia wants to invoke so-called Mutually Assured Destruction, or a full global thermonuclear escalation that would end life on earth. Therefore, that will not and cannot happen. Accordingly, that possibility is of limited utility as a deterrence against Russia.</p><p>Likewise, Russia’s war isn’t just about Ukraine, it’s about creating a multi-polar world. Aleksandr Dugin, who seems to be the closest thing to the author of this war anyone can find despite protestations to the contrary, suggested today that its alliance with China is both important and mutual, and that China needs a sovereign Russia to survive. Whether this is fantasy or not doesn’t matter; if it’s informing Russian reality then it’s important to consider.</p><h3>Samuel Ramani on Twitter: \"Alexander Dugin has pushed back against concerns in Russia about over-dependence on ChinaDugin said that although Russia needs China's support now, in the long-run, China will not be sovereign without Russia. Dugin also called China an \"ally\" in support of a multipolar order / Twitter\"</h3><p>Alexander Dugin has pushed back against concerns in Russia about over-dependence on ChinaDugin said that although Russia needs China's support now, in the long-run, China will not be sovereign without Russia. Dugin also called China an \"ally\" in support of a multipolar order</p><p>As I have said repeatedly, expect Russia to attack NATO by pulling it into a conflict space that will, from Putin’s perspective, reveal its impotence and hypocrisy — a nuclear strike on a convoy crossing the Polish border; or a conventional strike on a high-value Western target; or some other kind of cyber or infrastructure attack through a proxy like Iran or North Korea. Everything is on the table, and if Putin formally declares war tomorrow, it would be reasonable to expect more of the kinds of chaos-making many of us, myself included, expected to see accompany the February invasion but which has largely failed to materialize.</p><p>That escalation could come as soon as tomorrow, or immediately before, or some days after — it is impossible to predict. But if Putin does fail to achieve a kind of strategic “reset” for this war effort, he will certainly be facing a continuous drain of resources and a gradual slide into oblivion. Western allies are resolved in continuing to supply Ukraine with weapons and information, and that seems unlikely to change.</p><p>However they may use weapons of mass destruction, or find other ways to terrorize the West, and “shock” populations into an “anti-war” stance, led by Russia’s substantial but not overwhelming <a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/donald-trump/chomsky-calls-trump-the-one-western-statesman-who-laid-out-sensible-plan-for-addressing-russia-ukraine-crisis/\">Chomskyite</a> Fifth Column.</p><h3>The US Information War</h3><p>US disinfo channels suggested big shocks this week (“May 2–5”), such as the restoration of Donald Trump to the presidency.

That could be a recipe for disaster.</p><p>We can probably also expect at least some effort to intimidate western populations into ending support for sending arms and supplies to Ukraine. I believe Russia overestimates this “anti-war” sentiment in the West and believes they can effectuate a “win” by cowing democracies into submission — somehow. It doesn’t matter whether that can actually work; what matters is what they think they are doing and the harm that could be wrought in the process.</p><p>We should expect kinetic activity to follow information warfare, which is advancing.</p><h3>The Four Fronts of The Global Hybrid War</h3><p>The war in Ukraine is a global hybrid war, and the theater of warfare spans the globe to include the US and Europe. It is a war along four fronts: traditionalism, currency, nationalism, and energy.</p><p>The current attack on ‘Roe’ advances the traditionalist front and an agenda that’s already well-underway from the Russian Orthodox Church and its allies; the World Congress of Families laid the groundwork for this with US conservatives fueling anti-abortion and anti-LGBT agendas over the last 27 years or so.</p><h3>Rep.

While Nina Jankowicz is a qualified professional acting in good faith, she has sometimes been unnecessarily controversial. Overall though I don’t think the problem here is her, specifically, but rather how this was conceived and executed.</p><p>From my perspective this might have been better framed in several other ways, including as a matter of cognitive security, and perhaps placed directly inside CISA, and more quietly and less explicitly political-seeming. Likewise, it would have been potentially smart to involve FBI and the State Department’s Global Engagement Center as they already are doing some of this.</p><p>And ultimately, disinformation is as much a counterintelligence issue as it is a matter of digital artifacts. Arguably we have not done enough to study the sources, motives, and funding of those pushing disinformation, and because its producers do so along a Power Law curve, raising costs of specific networks of bad actors can have dramatic effects on limiting the invention and amplification of bad faith narratives.</p><p>No one should seek to limit information spread in good faith, but spreading information in bad faith with the intentions of harming society as a whole should be both hard and expensive. One valid concern that’s been raised is what happens with this Board under a far-right leaning administration, and what its tasking is even in the current context. For these reasons I think it would have been better to make this a professional counterintelligence function.</p><p>Focusing on disinformation artifacts instead of their effects on social ties and radicalization continues to be a key blindspot. We need to redirect our understanding of these phenomena in terms of how they function to erode society and make us more cultish and unruly — qualities incompatible with democracy. I have a whitepaper on that <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R_aVUrbAmkVXFF1vJWxnXE03FBtpxE8jkHF9P53n4Qk/edit\">here</a>.</p><h3>Why Elon’s Buying Twitter</h3><p>Elon Musk seems to be engaged in a no-holds-barred effort to try to acquire Twitter for the purposes of bending reality, to serve his mission to go to Mars; it appears that to do that he believes he needs to dismantle consensus reality and as much of USG as possible.</p><h3>Elon Musk on Twitter: \"Per aspera ad astra! / Twitter\"</h3><p>Per aspera ad astra!</p><p>He and Peter Thiel, longtime “frenemies” have become increasingly close and have united around the mission of “Ad Astra Per Aspera,” where the “Per Aspera” (through hardships) part seems to be to capture the USG. Thiel’s dark money PAC that funded JD Vance’s victory yesterday is called “<a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2022/02/peter-thiel-tied-dark-money-group-helping-bankroll-super-pac-spending-on-2022-election/\">Per Aspera Policy</a>.” The phrase, also the state motto of Kansas, was also likely chosen because “Per Aspera Policy” had originally been backed by Thiel to support Kris Kobach’s failed 2018 bid for Kansas governor.</p><h3>jack⚡️ on Twitter: \"I'm so happy Twitter will continue to serve the public conversation.

Sacks, and Jack Dorsey, who has also adopted “to the stars” language. This is all rooted in reactionary libertarianism and longtermism, as championed by Nick Bostrom, a Musk-Thiel pal. It posits that what happens to people today is less important than the fates of all of those (including AI’s) that may come after us.

Many have speculated that Russia may announce a full-blown war on Ukraine tomorrow, a move which could escalate violence and pull in conscripts from across Russia and its client states. The conflict may also escalate to include so-called “nazis” globally, including within NATO countries. And it’s true, some kind of escalation feels inevitable; Putin’s current approach simply isn’t sustainable. Today, US first lady <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/ukraine-us-first-lady-jill-biden-makes-surprise-visit-to-ukraine-live-updates/a-61721480\">Jill Biden</a> and the band <a href=\"https://www.rte.ie/news/ukraine/2022/0508/1296762-bono-ukraine-latest/\">U2</a> are visiting Kyiv, which feels almost like a provocation to Russia. Recent reports that US intelligence has been <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/05/us/politics/moskva-russia-ship-ukraine-us.html\">feeding targeting data</a> to Ukraine have made headlines, which serve to further taunt Putin. While these actions serve to diminish Russian morale, we should also expect they may enrage Putin and his inner circle.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/05/us/politics/moskva-russia-ship-ukraine-us.html\">U.S. Intelligence Helped Ukraine Strike Russian Flagship, Officials Say</a></p><p>Russia celebrates May 9th, the anniversary of the date on which the Red Army helped to defeat the Nazis in Berlin, annually, with a massive military parade. Of course, the celebration is based on a lie: World War II (or “The Great Patriotic War” as it has been known in Russia) was co-authored by Stalin, the victory over the Nazis was a result of the efforts of the Allies, and the Red Army notoriously <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_during_the_occupation_of_Germany\">raped</a> its way across Berlin before Hitler finally <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Adolf_Hitler\">shot himself</a> on April 30, 1945. Regardless, Putin will celebrate “Victory Day” tomorrow with a massive parade and show of equipment — even if it’s just cardboard cutouts. It’s unclear what gear Russia’s military can afford to withhold from its Ukraine campaign, beset as it is with equipment and materiel shortages and ongoing <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-suffers-another-fire-at-a-supply-depot-as-its-ukraine-offensive-pushes-west-11651057494\">destruction</a> and sabotage of its supply chain.</p><h3>What We Might Expect</h3><p>Russia has ramped up its nuclear rhetoric to unprecedented levels. It has threatened to <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/next/2022/05/04/what-is-russia-s-poseidon-nuclear-drone-and-could-it-wipe-out-the-uk-in-a-radioactive-tsun\">drown Britain</a> in a radioactive tsunami set off by a nuclear warhead delivered via drone. <a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/putin-rather-press-nuclear-button-lose-ukraine-war-rt-broadcaster-151707840.html\">Margarita Simonyan</a> (or as I call her, Marge) has offered that Russia has two options: losing its Ukraine war, or embarking on “World War III.” Of the two, she sees the latter as more likely. “We’re all going to do die someday,” she offered, comfortingly.</p><p>More recently, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexei Zaitsev <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/world/russia-says-it-wont-use-nuclear-weapons-in-ukraine\">said</a> that recent rhetoric is overblown and that Russia will not use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, and that “there can be no winners in a nuclear war.”</p><p>The only North Star when dealing with Russia is that they can never be counted on to tell the truth, but they often give hints about what they may do. My opinion is that neither NATO or Russia wants to invoke so-called Mutually Assured Destruction, or a full global thermonuclear escalation that would end life on earth. Therefore, that will not and cannot happen. Accordingly, that possibility is of limited utility as a deterrence against Russia.</p><p>Likewise, Russia’s war isn’t just about Ukraine, it’s about creating a multi-polar world. Aleksandr Dugin, who seems to be the closest thing to the author of this war anyone can find despite protestations to the contrary, suggested today that its alliance with China is both important and mutual, and that China needs a sovereign Russia to survive. Whether this is fantasy or not doesn’t matter; if it’s informing Russian reality then it’s important to consider.</p><h3>Samuel Ramani on Twitter: \"Alexander Dugin has pushed back against concerns in Russia about over-dependence on ChinaDugin said that although Russia needs China's support now, in the long-run, China will not be sovereign without Russia.

Arguably we have not done enough to study the sources, motives, and funding of those pushing disinformation, and because its producers do so along a Power Law curve, raising costs of specific networks of bad actors can have dramatic effects on limiting the invention and amplification of bad faith narratives.</p><p>No one should seek to limit information spread in good faith, but spreading information in bad faith with the intentions of harming society as a whole should be both hard and expensive. One valid concern that’s been raised is what happens with this Board under a far-right leaning administration, and what its tasking is even in the current context. For these reasons I think it would have been better to make this a professional counterintelligence function.</p><p>Focusing on disinformation artifacts instead of their effects on social ties and radicalization continues to be a key blindspot. We need to redirect our understanding of these phenomena in terms of how they function to erode society and make us more cultish and unruly — qualities incompatible with democracy. I have a whitepaper on that <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R_aVUrbAmkVXFF1vJWxnXE03FBtpxE8jkHF9P53n4Qk/edit\">here</a>.</p><h3>Why Elon’s Buying Twitter</h3><p>Elon Musk seems to be engaged in a no-holds-barred effort to try to acquire Twitter for the purposes of bending reality, to serve his mission to go to Mars; it appears that to do that he believes he needs to dismantle consensus reality and as much of USG as possible.</p><h3>Elon Musk on Twitter: \"Per aspera ad astra! / Twitter\"</h3><p>Per aspera ad astra!</p><p>He and Peter Thiel, longtime “frenemies” have become increasingly close and have united around the mission of “Ad Astra Per Aspera,” where the “Per Aspera” (through hardships) part seems to be to capture the USG. Thiel’s dark money PAC that funded JD Vance’s victory yesterday is called “<a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2022/02/peter-thiel-tied-dark-money-group-helping-bankroll-super-pac-spending-on-2022-election/\">Per Aspera Policy</a>.” The phrase, also the state motto of Kansas, was also likely chosen because “Per Aspera Policy” had originally been backed by Thiel to support Kris Kobach’s failed 2018 bid for Kansas governor.</p><h3>jack⚡️ on Twitter: \"I'm so happy Twitter will continue to serve the public conversation.

I am watching the situation closely though for ways to add value to the conversation. The war in Ukraine is grinding forward, and we are seeing increasing evidence of widespread war crimes against civilians. The massacre in Bucha in particular has struck a global nerve, and people seem both ready to do whetever is necessary to end this scourge, and also somewhat resigned to the banality of violence. We should all be considering the emotional impacts of consuming imagery of violence and death and give ourselves what’s needed to process it.</p><p>My opinion is that this war is in its opening phases and that it will continue until Putin’s capabilities are fully exhausted. That could take a while, and may involve escalations that we can’t anticipate. Towards that end, I want to share a few projects that speak to the current situation.</p><h3>New Podcast Episode with Wesley Clark, Jr.</h3><p>This week I dropped <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dave-troy-presents/id1610914569?i=1000556196740\">Episode 12</a> of my podcast series <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dave-troy-presents/id1610914569\">“Dave Troy Presents: Oil, Gold, Crypto, and Fascism”</a> featuring US Army veteran and climate activist Wesley Clark, Jr. Wes’s experiences run the gamut of everything we’re facing right now, from the end of oil, to PSYOPs and influence, to global war.

The history is more complex, and frankly, delicate. I’ll attempt to explain here briefly.</p><p>During World War II, some Ukrainians sympathized with Hitler because they either admired fascism, hated Russia, or both. They coalesced into an organization called the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN). That group had two factions, the OUN-M led by Andrew Melnyk, and the OUN-B, led by Stepan Bandera. OUN-B was much more extremist, and aligned with the Nazis. (It also capitalized on the considerable lingering resentment and anti-Russian sentiment that resulted from the Holodomor, Stalin’s mass starvation campaign in 1932-1933.)</p><p>In 1941 Yaroslav Stetsko and OUN-B led a massacre of Jews in Lviv (or Lwow, to reflect its then-Polish status), and proclaimed himself premier of a new short-lived Ukrainian government, with allegiance to the Nazis. After the war, the OUN-B remained aligned with various anti-communist factions around the world and collaborated with the ABBN (anti-Bolshevik Bloc of Nations), the WACL (World Anti-Communist League), and the Asian People’s Anti-Communist League.</p><p>The Korean CIA, Moonies, and Taiwanese nationalists, allied with these European factions to fight communism; they persisted throughout the Cold War and Reagan endorsed the OUN-B, going so far as to appoint its affiliates to key positions in/near his administration. But as alarming as that sounds, the OUN-B was a small faction of rabid fascist nationalists and not representative of the broader coalition of pro-democracy factions that emerged in Ukraine after 1991.</p><p>But the OUN-B hated one thing even more than communists: Russian imperialism.</p><p>Since Putin’s rise to power, he has resented this small OUN-B faction because it historically resisted Russia’s imperial advances. No longer important politically in Ukraine, today’s far-right parties struggle to gain more than about 2.3% of the vote.</p><p>By contrast, Germany’s far-right AfD party has attracted around 10% of the vote, more recently. So which country has more of a Nazi problem? Thankfully, far right parties are failing to gain much support anywhere in Europe today.</p><p>The fact that Zelensky is himself Jewish makes claims of “denazification” by Russia seem all the more ludicrous; but it makes more sense (kinda) when you understand this backstory about the OUN-B.</p><p>In 2014, when Putin illegally invaded Ukraine for the first time they also invoked this “Ukrainian nazis” narrative and it was as stupid then as it is now. But Putin is trying to exploit this odd bit of history, and the revulsion towards 20th century naziism as a propaganda device for his military and domestic audience.</p><p>I hope this makes more sense now and will help people debunk Russia’s lies more effectively. Primary source for this was Russ Bellant’s “<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/633705.Old_Nazis_the_New_Right_and_the_Republican_Party\">Old Nazis, The New Right, and the Republican Party</a>” (1988) pp. 69–73. The book is worth the read, especially right now.</p><h3>The Dugin Playbook</h3><p>I shared a brief update with friends this week:</p><blockquote>I don’t see any signs that Putin will back off from the <a href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftec.fsi.stanford.edu%2Fdocs%2Faleksandr-dugins-foundations-geopolitics%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0m1FWmWdpMCcXyLXZP1c-CX4uZvCVRL1SdMnPWrUexMrv4dWBFEmLqU-s&h=AT3aiUCUb_d6S8dQXKhQU4INnpkQKluliQF2y1SBWHG4jgaD7vayWMKEGm68MKQeu6xoR0NVHfFpAiyO49H3YISz_28jtrWkW8L9GfTUgsE2wb8HgfxSIsn8UZQSQYpxI8k_TjM&__tn__=R]-R&c[0]=AT3F9aS47CRDsCOKiQhPUIx8lQB267p4ieSRNUqoafeP3cUqqA7jQbtoZUgJGdoG8s83FY3G4zhFFbv48M4TPzZdSHsWUSLymm6os7ueyHOF-CWjZHPwAfBsv1Pktp3HJ9SrnAsDhzo169j65_ZP\">Dugin playbook</a>. I don’t see many signs that the West understands that. Nuclear war may only be avoidable if Putin’s orders are ignored.</blockquote><blockquote>Look, Dugin is nuts. That doesn’t mean his isn’t the playbook being used. In fact, I can find no material departure from his strategy as defined in “Foundations” in the events of the last 5 years.</blockquote><blockquote>Dugin throws around the terms “eschaton” and “katechon” a lot. Look them up. I’m getting tired of warning people about this and being gaslit by casual observers who haven’t studied the work. <a href=\"https://davetroy.medium.com/the-swamp-and-the-fire-an-urgent-warning-to-the-west-c5b27e2715b8\">Been saying this since 2017</a>. Correct so far.</blockquote><blockquote>Only question is timing, and whether Putin’s orders will be obeyed. I do not say this lightly. We need to assume this is the strategy, because it absolutely has been so far — nuts or not. Ignore at our peril.</blockquote><h3>All For Now</h3><p>As mentioned, it’s been an incredibly busy few weeks, and I’m working on some important new projects that will be released soon. I remain concerned as ever about the war and think we’re heading into something much more protracted, complex, and global than anyone is willing to admit right now. Elon Musk’s <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-twitter-board-of-directors-132707294.html\">soft takeover of Twitter</a> this week is <strong>not</strong> a good development and speaks to more trouble ahead, something I’ll have to get into another time. But in the meantime, we should be looking at all such shifts as preparation for a future phase, and a good question to ask might be what steps would he be anticipating where having direct control over the global information environment would be useful? Many have pointed to the idea that Trump may be allowed back on the platform, but frankly I think that’s the least of our worries (though it, too, may happen).</p><p><a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/why-longtermism-is-the-worlds-most-dangerous-secular-credo\">Why longtermism is the world's most dangerous secular credo | Aeon Essays</a></p><p>If Musk is as <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2022/03/grimes-cover-story-on-music-and-mars\">committed to “The Mission”</a> as his baby-mama pal Grimes seems to indicate, then we need to be thinking about what exactly Nick Bostrom’s “<a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/why-longtermism-is-the-worlds-most-dangerous-secular-credo\">Long-Termism</a>” might countenance in terms of global conflict. It’s possibly akin to Jim Jones buying the San Francisco Chronicle, to draw an analogy.

I am watching the situation closely though for ways to add value to the conversation. The war in Ukraine is grinding forward, and we are seeing increasing evidence of widespread war crimes against civilians. The massacre in Bucha in particular has struck a global nerve, and people seem both ready to do whetever is necessary to end this scourge, and also somewhat resigned to the banality of violence. We should all be considering the emotional impacts of consuming imagery of violence and death and give ourselves what’s needed to process it.</p><p>My opinion is that this war is in its opening phases and that it will continue until Putin’s capabilities are fully exhausted. That could take a while, and may involve escalations that we can’t anticipate. Towards that end, I want to share a few projects that speak to the current situation.</p><h3>New Podcast Episode with Wesley Clark, Jr.</h3><p>This week I dropped <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dave-troy-presents/id1610914569?i=1000556196740\">Episode 12</a> of my podcast series <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dave-troy-presents/id1610914569\">“Dave Troy Presents: Oil, Gold, Crypto, and Fascism”</a> featuring US Army veteran and climate activist Wesley Clark, Jr. Wes’s experiences run the gamut of everything we’re facing right now, from the end of oil, to PSYOPs and influence, to global war.

Many believed him to be a cold rationalist, calculating for concessions from the west. But his actions say something different — about his actual motivations, mindset, and ultimate goals. As he appears to become increasingly isolated, what do science and history tell us about how to gauge his mindset, and how he may behave? And how might insights into Putin’s mindset inform our understanding of so-called authoritarian “strongmen” more broadly? Please join us as three leading experts (Bandy Lee, Steve Hassan, and Nick Carmody) offer their points of view on this complicated set of topics, and we discuss your questions.</p><p><strong>Nuclear Weapons and the War in Ukraine:</strong> Vladimir Putin’s illegal war in Ukraine has raised the spectre of whether and how nuclear weapons might be deployed. While the use of nuclear weapons is widely considered to be “unthinkable,” and may lead to unpredictable escalation and even mutually assured destruction, we are now faced with the possibility that new, smaller tactical weapons may be used as part of a strategy to “escalate to de-escalate.” We’ll hear from nuclear weapons experts Emma Belcher and Sarah Bidgood about what’s real, what’s not, and most importantly how we can maximize the probability that nuclear weapons are never deployed.</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fembed.ted.com%2Ftalks%2Femma_belcher_3_questions_we_should_ask_about_nuclear_weapons&display_name=TED&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ted.com%2Ftalks%2Femma_belcher_3_questions_we_should_ask_about_nuclear_weapons&image=https%3A%2F%2Fpi.tedcdn.com%2Fr%2Ftalkstar-photos.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fd7aaace4-0d2b-480e-bf57-4612de4d57b9%2FEmmaBelcher_2019X-embed.jpg%3Fh%3D316%26w%3D560&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=ted\" width=\"560\" height=\"316\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/8148f0481d6d8456cfc5211a00c56a2d/href\">https://medium.com/media/8148f0481d6d8456cfc5211a00c56a2d/href</a></iframe><p><a href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ted.com%2Ftalks%2Femma_belcher_3_questions_we_should_ask_about_nuclear_weapons%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1NOvcnNsuDUB8MDJXSukBQ569_8f9pkboYkEBgv3lVknGlBf76omUzQKw&h=AT3tav3pi_gXjZVPbFGjcjFy-coYw4bIoxfdsR1WgC3kKZ8T2fig49DG-56kdcnqL8cqvmPRc3zWzx0JPsPccsiYddLHQHlFpYV2jlf-4UEKfo_q1MMzQmey5yqcXwqm9Xnr8I8&__tn__=%2CmH-R&c[0]=AT1inbn2Bp6ymf5-APZnTzr4J-Q-wU-Y9kJifdvXbt4ARwjaPF10NABiba_DGAH6KIgZipBV_6wC9_TqMnqoagWBUX1bqc5N9VMVlzBmZQ2WGJFdMo0GFP5fGawckURpt_Xbqa3vsqLQtC8GQDgMZoyy6eE\">Emma Belcher spoke at TEDxMidAtlantic in 2019</a> — during the before times—and her talk has now been viewed over 2 million times!

The history is more complex, and frankly, delicate. I’ll attempt to explain here briefly.</p><p>During World War II, some Ukrainians sympathized with Hitler because they either admired fascism, hated Russia, or both. They coalesced into an organization called the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN). That group had two factions, the OUN-M led by Andrew Melnyk, and the OUN-B, led by Stepan Bandera. OUN-B was much more extremist, and aligned with the Nazis. (It also capitalized on the considerable lingering resentment and anti-Russian sentiment that resulted from the Holodomor, Stalin’s mass starvation campaign in 1932-1933.)</p><p>In 1941 Yaroslav Stetsko and OUN-B led a massacre of Jews in Lviv (or Lwow, to reflect its then-Polish status), and proclaimed himself premier of a new short-lived Ukrainian government, with allegiance to the Nazis. After the war, the OUN-B remained aligned with various anti-communist factions around the world and collaborated with the ABBN (anti-Bolshevik Bloc of Nations), the WACL (World Anti-Communist League), and the Asian People’s Anti-Communist League.</p><p>The Korean CIA, Moonies, and Taiwanese nationalists, allied with these European factions to fight communism; they persisted throughout the Cold War and Reagan endorsed the OUN-B, going so far as to appoint its affiliates to key positions in/near his administration. But as alarming as that sounds, the OUN-B was a small faction of rabid fascist nationalists and not representative of the broader coalition of pro-democracy factions that emerged in Ukraine after 1991.</p><p>But the OUN-B hated one thing even more than communists: Russian imperialism.</p><p>Since Putin’s rise to power, he has resented this small OUN-B faction because it historically resisted Russia’s imperial advances. No longer important politically in Ukraine, today’s far-right parties struggle to gain more than about 2.3% of the vote.</p><p>By contrast, Germany’s far-right AfD party has attracted around 10% of the vote, more recently. So which country has more of a Nazi problem? Thankfully, far right parties are failing to gain much support anywhere in Europe today.</p><p>The fact that Zelensky is himself Jewish makes claims of “denazification” by Russia seem all the more ludicrous; but it makes more sense (kinda) when you understand this backstory about the OUN-B.</p><p>In 2014, when Putin illegally invaded Ukraine for the first time they also invoked this “Ukrainian nazis” narrative and it was as stupid then as it is now. But Putin is trying to exploit this odd bit of history, and the revulsion towards 20th century naziism as a propaganda device for his military and domestic audience.</p><p>I hope this makes more sense now and will help people debunk Russia’s lies more effectively. Primary source for this was Russ Bellant’s “<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/633705.Old_Nazis_the_New_Right_and_the_Republican_Party\">Old Nazis, The New Right, and the Republican Party</a>” (1988) pp. 69–73. The book is worth the read, especially right now.</p><h3>The Dugin Playbook</h3><p>I shared a brief update with friends this week:</p><blockquote>I don’t see any signs that Putin will back off from the <a href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftec.fsi.stanford.edu%2Fdocs%2Faleksandr-dugins-foundations-geopolitics%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0m1FWmWdpMCcXyLXZP1c-CX4uZvCVRL1SdMnPWrUexMrv4dWBFEmLqU-s&h=AT3aiUCUb_d6S8dQXKhQU4INnpkQKluliQF2y1SBWHG4jgaD7vayWMKEGm68MKQeu6xoR0NVHfFpAiyO49H3YISz_28jtrWkW8L9GfTUgsE2wb8HgfxSIsn8UZQSQYpxI8k_TjM&__tn__=R]-R&c[0]=AT3F9aS47CRDsCOKiQhPUIx8lQB267p4ieSRNUqoafeP3cUqqA7jQbtoZUgJGdoG8s83FY3G4zhFFbv48M4TPzZdSHsWUSLymm6os7ueyHOF-CWjZHPwAfBsv1Pktp3HJ9SrnAsDhzo169j65_ZP\">Dugin playbook</a>. I don’t see many signs that the West understands that. Nuclear war may only be avoidable if Putin’s orders are ignored.</blockquote><blockquote>Look, Dugin is nuts. That doesn’t mean his isn’t the playbook being used. In fact, I can find no material departure from his strategy as defined in “Foundations” in the events of the last 5 years.</blockquote><blockquote>Dugin throws around the terms “eschaton” and “katechon” a lot. Look them up. I’m getting tired of warning people about this and being gaslit by casual observers who haven’t studied the work. <a href=\"https://davetroy.medium.com/the-swamp-and-the-fire-an-urgent-warning-to-the-west-c5b27e2715b8\">Been saying this since 2017</a>. Correct so far.</blockquote><blockquote>Only question is timing, and whether Putin’s orders will be obeyed. I do not say this lightly. We need to assume this is the strategy, because it absolutely has been so far — nuts or not. Ignore at our peril.</blockquote><h3>All For Now</h3><p>As mentioned, it’s been an incredibly busy few weeks, and I’m working on some important new projects that will be released soon. I remain concerned as ever about the war and think we’re heading into something much more protracted, complex, and global than anyone is willing to admit right now. Elon Musk’s <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-twitter-board-of-directors-132707294.html\">soft takeover of Twitter</a> this week is <strong>not</strong> a good development and speaks to more trouble ahead, something I’ll have to get into another time. But in the meantime, we should be looking at all such shifts as preparation for a future phase, and a good question to ask might be what steps would he be anticipating where having direct control over the global information environment would be useful? Many have pointed to the idea that Trump may be allowed back on the platform, but frankly I think that’s the least of our worries (though it, too, may happen).</p><p><a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/why-longtermism-is-the-worlds-most-dangerous-secular-credo\">Why longtermism is the world's most dangerous secular credo | Aeon Essays</a></p><p>If Musk is as <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2022/03/grimes-cover-story-on-music-and-mars\">committed to “The Mission”</a> as his baby-mama pal Grimes seems to indicate, then we need to be thinking about what exactly Nick Bostrom’s “<a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/why-longtermism-is-the-worlds-most-dangerous-secular-credo\">Long-Termism</a>” might countenance in terms of global conflict. It’s possibly akin to Jim Jones buying the San Francisco Chronicle, to draw an analogy. The idea that a neo-reactionary “dark enlightment” mindset may become pervasive and unavoidable is unpleasant.</p><p><em>We’re interested in the major historical trends that shape current events.

The document’s scope is sweeping and broad, and supports global “multipolarity” while denouncing US hegemony and multi-national alliances like NATO. It also asserts that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SethDaire/status/1502886905331003393?s=20&t=w8QlP6GtFSSeyvXUQ9bmVg\">Taiwan is part of China</a>. The agreement suggests a long-term commitment to a broad global realignment. Also notable: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SethDaire/status/1502894807341019136?s=20&t=w8QlP6GtFSSeyvXUQ9bmVg\">Russia and China agreed</a> to amplify disinformation about US biolabs in Ukraine.

Per the agreement:</p><blockquote>“Friendship between the two States has no limits, there are no ”forbidden“ areas of cooperation, strengthening of bilateral strategic cooperation is neither aimed against third countries nor affected by the changing international environment and circumstantial changes in third countries.”</blockquote><h3>Seth Daire on Twitter: \"Russia and China talked about this on Feb 4.

Given the sweeping, “no limits” agreement between the two countries, it is plausible to expect China to deliver material support to Russia constrained only by its own capacity to do so, as well as any limits it may impose to avoid sanctions of its own. However, US appetite for Chinese sanctions may be limited, as it could exacerbate existing domestic concerns over inflation and energy prices.</p><h3>Edward Wong on Twitter: \"Amb.

Exposing NATO as hypocritical is key to this pursuit, and he can do that by testing NATO, showing that it will not in fact stand up for its alliance. Once he has proven that, he believes he will have moral justification not only for taking Ukraine, but any other NATO state that he sets his eyes on. In fact, he has greatly underestimated the alliance’s unity and resolve, which was in tatters under the Trump administration. However, whether or not Putin <em>believes</em> the alliance is as strong as it actually is may be open to question inside the reality-warping walls of the Kremlin. My personal belief is that testing NATO is key to Putin’s plans and necessary within the broader framework of Duginism which he appears to be working.

In 2017, there was much controversy over the fact that North Korea had somehow quickly advanced its missile capability. <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/north-korea-s-new-missile-technology-may-have-soviet-roots-n852231\">Some analysts concluded</a> that North Korea was using old rocket engines recovered from the former USSR, possibly from eastern Ukraine, and may have been transferred to the rogue state after Russia’s 2014 invasion of that region.

He is attempting to utilize elements of the Orthodox and Catholic churches to “flip” the world around a new axis, as theorized in Dugin’s “<em>Foundations of Geopolitics.</em>” Critically, Putin has reached into a societal layer <strong>beneath</strong> politics and diplomacy: <strong>culture</strong>. He (and his collaborators) have framed their struggle in terms of <em>aggrievement</em> and believe their “true and just” culture and cause has been the victim of international globalists. To prevail, they will deploy the righteousness of the land-based traditionalists against the sea-based globalists. Nevermind that Putin probably doesn’t actually believe in religion, <em>per se</em>. What he does understand is that he has a powerful cultural weapon that he can deploy.

No predictive model that excludes these elements will yield successful forecasts.</p><p><strong>Q: Zelensky has suggested Ukraine may back off of its goal of joining NATO. Will this help anything?</strong><br>A: No. There is not any off-ramp where Putin will settle for less than total domination of Ukraine. Likewise, suggestions that curbing “NATO expansionism” could have prevented this conflict are fantastical. Even if NATO had not expanded, Putin would have found other excuses to pursue his revanchist agenda of “reunification of the Rus people.”</p><h3>PBS NewsHour on Twitter: \"WATCH LIVE: Zelensky to deliver virtual address to U.S. Congress https://t.co/Od8mUgDDOl / Twitter\"</h3><p>WATCH LIVE: Zelensky to deliver virtual address to U.S. Congress https://t.co/Od8mUgDDOl</p><p><strong>Q: Zelensky </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/NewsHour/status/1504079342103633921?s=20&t=ajYmQsFoVn0ViO5MHFSOCw\"><strong>addressed Congress</strong></a><strong> and made a graphic, emotional appeal for a no fly zone. Will that happen?<br></strong>A: Probably not, as the US and NATO remain concerned that a full on confrontation will result and Putin will blame us for it. Other solutions, such as a <a href=\"https://mail.atlanticcouncil.org/NjU5LVdaWC0wNzUAAAGDGf-u4v_0m0JAqG-m3TBcs2JMxiI2kE9TN4SJvM1yMI5cwHLFTqVU4AX9flmt31e4cN2GlOo=\">lend-lease program</a>, seem to be gaining some momentum. Also likely is that Putin will soon escalate to provoke a confrontation via oblique means, in which case we will enter the vast gray-zone between non-interventionism and total thermonuclear war. Because that middle ground is filled with uncertainty and the possibility of errors, everyone wishes to avoid it; but Putin seems increasingly intent on dragging us all there. Again, the best possible thing would be if someone inside Russia were to remove him from power; even as the result might later be worse, it may buy us some time to explore other outcomes.</p><h3>A Personal Appeal</h3><p>One of my closest friends, Nate Mook, is the CEO of World Central Kitchen, the global humanitarian organization run by Chef José Andrés.

The document’s scope is sweeping and broad, and supports global “multipolarity” while denouncing US hegemony and multi-national alliances like NATO. It also asserts that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SethDaire/status/1502886905331003393?s=20&t=w8QlP6GtFSSeyvXUQ9bmVg\">Taiwan is part of China</a>.

Per the agreement:</p><blockquote>“Friendship between the two States has no limits, there are no ”forbidden“ areas of cooperation, strengthening of bilateral strategic cooperation is neither aimed against third countries nor affected by the changing international environment and circumstantial changes in third countries.”</blockquote><h3>Seth Daire on Twitter: \"Russia and China talked about this on Feb 4.

Given the sweeping, “no limits” agreement between the two countries, it is plausible to expect China to deliver material support to Russia constrained only by its own capacity to do so, as well as any limits it may impose to avoid sanctions of its own. However, US appetite for Chinese sanctions may be limited, as it could exacerbate existing domestic concerns over inflation and energy prices.</p><h3>Edward Wong on Twitter: \"Amb.

Exposing NATO as hypocritical is key to this pursuit, and he can do that by testing NATO, showing that it will not in fact stand up for its alliance. Once he has proven that, he believes he will have moral justification not only for taking Ukraine, but any other NATO state that he sets his eyes on. In fact, he has greatly underestimated the alliance’s unity and resolve, which was in tatters under the Trump administration. However, whether or not Putin <em>believes</em> the alliance is as strong as it actually is may be open to question inside the reality-warping walls of the Kremlin. My personal belief is that testing NATO is key to Putin’s plans and necessary within the broader framework of Duginism which he appears to be working.

And on March 2nd, the Episcopate of Ukraine <a href=\"http://kmc.media/2022/03/02/yepyskopy-ukrayiny-prosyat-papu-prysvyatyty-ukrayinu-ta-rosiyu-sercyu-mariyi.html\">made the same request</a>. This creates a rich environment for the proliferation of multiple interpretations of these events, giving several factions grounds for mystical justification of nearly any action, including apocalypse through the use of nuclear weapons.</p><ol><li>Traditionalists aren’t happy this Pope is doing this, because they <a href=\"https://gaudiumetspes22.com/blog/pope-francis-vs-the-traditionalists-it-was-never-about-the-liturgy\">hate him</a>.</li><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JMNg17/status/1504156490067701760?s=20&t=vMiC4aBXk12rx0Yn1GU5yg\">Traditionalists aren’t happy</a> that he’s addressing both Russia and Ukraine, and don’t have “all the bishops” involved.</li><li>Putin might be happy he’s consecrating both Russia and Ukraine, because it recognizes some historical oneness as “Russia,” per the prophecy.</li></ol><p>I don’t think anyone knows how this may play out in practice, but the fact that Third Rome and the Fatima secrets have been on our radar for a long time as material to this conflict should be of concern, especially when the Pope is now actively engaging with it. My friend Izabella Kaminska has a <a href=\"https://the-blindspot.com/ww3-watch-an-unexpected-intervention-from-the-vatican/\">more detailed writeup</a>.</p><p><strong>Also, a warning: anyone writing off the religious and Duginist aspects of this war is making a serious error. </strong>Yes, Putin is a thug, but as an instrumentalist he knows the power of language, symbols, networks, and religion to effect the outcomes he desires. No predictive model that excludes these elements will yield successful forecasts.</p><p><strong>Q: Zelensky has suggested Ukraine may back off of its goal of joining NATO. Will this help anything?</strong><br>A: No. There is not any off-ramp where Putin will settle for less than total domination of Ukraine. Likewise, suggestions that curbing “NATO expansionism” could have prevented this conflict are fantastical. Even if NATO had not expanded, Putin would have found other excuses to pursue his revanchist agenda of “reunification of the Rus people.”</p><h3>PBS NewsHour on Twitter: \"WATCH LIVE: Zelensky to deliver virtual address to U.S. Congress https://t.co/Od8mUgDDOl / Twitter\"</h3><p>WATCH LIVE: Zelensky to deliver virtual address to U.S. Congress https://t.co/Od8mUgDDOl</p><p><strong>Q: Zelensky </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/NewsHour/status/1504079342103633921?s=20&t=ajYmQsFoVn0ViO5MHFSOCw\"><strong>addressed Congress</strong></a><strong> and made a graphic, emotional appeal for a no fly zone. Will that happen?<br></strong>A: Probably not, as the US and NATO remain concerned that a full on confrontation will result and Putin will blame us for it. Other solutions, such as a <a href=\"https://mail.atlanticcouncil.org/NjU5LVdaWC0wNzUAAAGDGf-u4v_0m0JAqG-m3TBcs2JMxiI2kE9TN4SJvM1yMI5cwHLFTqVU4AX9flmt31e4cN2GlOo=\">lend-lease program</a>, seem to be gaining some momentum. Also likely is that Putin will soon escalate to provoke a confrontation via oblique means, in which case we will enter the vast gray-zone between non-interventionism and total thermonuclear war. Because that middle ground is filled with uncertainty and the possibility of errors, everyone wishes to avoid it; but Putin seems increasingly intent on dragging us all there. Again, the best possible thing would be if someone inside Russia were to remove him from power; even as the result might later be worse, it may buy us some time to explore other outcomes.</p><h3>A Personal Appeal</h3><p>One of my closest friends, Nate Mook, is the CEO of World Central Kitchen, the global humanitarian organization run by Chef José Andrés.
